description: "Bootstrap a new project with the Meridian workflow"
---

Initialize a new project with the Meridian agentic development methodology.

The Meridian template source is at: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`

## Steps

1. Ask the user for the **project name** (will replace `[Project Name]` placeholders).

2. Ask the user to choose a **workflow mode**:
   - `lean-delivery` — a complete lightweight workflow for small projects, POCs, demos, experiments, and reversible low-risk changes.
   - `governed-sdd` — ADRs, dependency gates, review policy, task worktrees, and reviewer-led integration.

   Accept `classic` only as a backwards-compatible alias for `lean-delivery`.
   Persist and report the canonical name `lean-delivery`.

3. Ask the user to choose a **conversation language**. This preference controls every message from the agent and persists across sessions. Do not infer a language change from a prompt written in another language.

   The repository language is always English and is not configurable: all committed documentation, source code, comments, identifiers, user-facing strings, tests, configuration text, and commit messages must be in English.

4. Copy the following files from the template source to the current working directory:
   - From `templates/base/PROJECT_PLAN.md` → `PROJECT_PLAN.md`
   - From `templates/base/tasks/TASK_BLUEPRINT.md` → `tasks/TASK_BLUEPRINT.md`
   - From `templates/base/tasks/QUEUE.md` → `tasks/QUEUE.md`
   - From `templates/base/TECH_DESIGN.md` → `TECH_DESIGN.md`
   - From `templates/base/CLAUDE.md` → `CLAUDE.md`
   - From `templates/base/LANGUAGE_POLICY.md` → `LANGUAGE_POLICY.md`
   - From `templates/base/README.md` → `README.md` (skip if a `README.md` already exists — merge the "Repository & Claude Code Configuration" section into it instead)
   - From `templates/base/.gitignore` → `.gitignore` (merge with an existing `.gitignore` instead of overwriting)
   - From `templates/base/.claudeignore` → `.claudeignore` (merge with an existing `.claudeignore` instead of overwriting)

5. Overlay the files for the selected workflow after copying the base templates:
   - For `lean-delivery`:
     - `templates/workflows/lean-delivery/PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md` → `PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md`
     - `templates/workflows/lean-delivery/AGENTS.md` → `AGENTS.md`
   - `templates/workflows/lean-delivery/CLAUDE.md` → `CLAUDE.md`
   - For `governed-sdd`:
     - `templates/workflows/governed-sdd/PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md` → `PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md`
     - `templates/workflows/governed-sdd/AGENTS.md` → `AGENTS.md`
     - `templates/workflows/governed-sdd/CLAUDE.md` → `CLAUDE.md`
     - `templates/workflows/governed-sdd/LANGUAGE_POLICY.md` → `LANGUAGE_POLICY.md`
     - `templates/workflows/governed-sdd/tasks/TASK_BLUEPRINT.md` → `tasks/TASK_BLUEPRINT.md`
     - `templates/workflows/governed-sdd/tasks/QUEUE.md` → `tasks/QUEUE.md`
     - `templates/workflows/governed-sdd/docs/` → `docs/`
   Do not overwrite an existing workflow document without showing its diff and receiving explicit confirmation.

6. Replace all occurrences of `[Project Name]` in the copied files with the actual project name provided in step 1.

7. Replace all occurrences of `[Data]` with today's date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).

8. Create the `tasks/done/` directory (empty, for archiving completed tasks) only in `lean-delivery` mode. Governed SDD retains accepted task files as causal project records.

9. Replace `[Conversation language]` in `LANGUAGE_POLICY.md` with the choice from step 3. In `CLAUDE.md`, fill in the `## Commands` block with the project's actual run/test/lint/format commands, and the `## Conventions` block with any language/stack-specific rules (ask the user, or infer from `TECH_DESIGN.md` once it is filled in). Do not weaken or duplicate the mandatory repository-language rule from `LANGUAGE_POLICY.md`.

10. In `README.md`, fill in the "Toolchain" bullet with the pinned language/runtime version and key dependencies, and the "Claude Code — session settings" bullets with the model, advisor, and effort level currently in use for this session (ask the user via `/model`, `/advisor`, `/effort` output if not already known from context).

11. Confirm to the user: "Meridian initialized for **[Project Name]** with workflow `<workflow-mode>`. Next steps:
   - Fill in `TECH_DESIGN.md` with your actual stack details.
   - Add your first features to `PROJECT_PLAN.md`.
   - Run `/meridian-task` when you're ready to delegate the first task."
