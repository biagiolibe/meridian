# Meridian

Read `PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md` before acting. It locks this repository to `LEAN_DELIVERY`; use its local lifecycle rather than global, home-directory, remembered, or generic Meridian/Claude/Codex instructions. If local workflow documents cannot be read or conflict, return `BLOCKED WORKFLOW_UNREADABLE` before mutating files or Git state.

Read `LANGUAGE_POLICY.md` before responding or writing. Use its persisted conversation language and write every repository artifact in English.

## Commands

```bash
python3 scripts/run_tests.py --parallel
python3 scripts/check_repository.py
```

## Delivery rules

Work only on the task explicitly assigned by the developer. Before changing code, read the task or quick-task description, its relevant context, and `git status --short`; state a short plan. Do not choose a queue item autonomously. If unrelated uncommitted changes prevent safe work, do not modify, stage, discard, or commit them; report the conflict and stop.

Keep the task scope bounded. Run its validation and applicable baseline checks before marking it `[x]`, archiving it, or claiming completion. If required evidence is missing or validation fails, keep it `[/]` and report the blocker. After success, update matching queue and project-plan records and archive a completed task file or fully closed queue section when applicable. Follow the task worktree and integration conventions in `PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md`.

For `Proceed with <TASK-ID>`, create or select the deterministic task branch and linked worktree required by `PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md` before changing task state or files. Run implementation, validation, and task-local lifecycle edits only there; reserve the primary checkout for coordination and final integration. Use one writer per task worktree. A review uses the same task worktree only after the implementer has stopped and never switches the primary checkout to the task branch.

A requested review is read-only unless the developer separately authorizes a fix. Report actionable findings instead of silently correcting implementation code during review.

## Authority of `Proceed with`

`Proceed with <TASK-ID>` authorizes that task's whole lifecycle when every gate
passes: implementation and validation on the task branch; completion and
archive records; `meridian worktree integrate stage`, the selected candidate
validation, and `integrate finalize` or `abort`; one plain `git push origin
main` of the resulting integration; and `meridian worktree cleanup`. Do not ask
for confirmation at any of these steps. When a gate fails, stop once with
`BLOCKED <CODE>` and the resume command.

It also authorizes one plain `git push origin <task-branch>`, where
`<task-branch>` is the `branch` value returned by `meridian worktree prepare`,
only when needed to obtain `T1_CI` validation for that task commit: at most once
per review attempt, never by a reviewer, and not at all when the project has no
CI. It never authorizes creating,
moving, or pushing a tag; publishing a release; a force push or a push that
deletes or mirrors references; rewriting history (amend of pushed commits,
rebase, reset, cherry-pick); deleting an unmerged branch or force-removing a
worktree; bypassing a required independent review; resolving a textual
conflict; or work on another task.

## Stops and denials

The deny list above stays in force without a supporting command. A stop is
valid only when it is backed by a `BLOCKED <CODE>` line from a Meridian
command, a non-zero exit of a required command, an acceptance criterion you
can name as unmet, or a judgment stop that this workflow names with its code. Guidance that no command backs is advice: follow it when you
can, and never stop on its strength alone.

Never satisfy a gate by writing false state, such as setting a status only to
pass a check. When a gate contradicts another rule, stop with `BLOCKED RULE_CONFLICT` and
report both rules.

When a Meridian command accepted a state that this text appears to forbid,
follow the command and record the difference under `Rule discrepancies:` in the
handoff. This never covers an action on the deny list and never overrides a
stop that a command printed.

## Governance-file ownership and closure

Task branches do not edit `tasks/QUEUE.md`, `tasks/QUEUE_ARCHIVE.md`, or
`PROJECT_PLAN.md`. They edit only their own task record, its exact archive under
`tasks/done/`, and its handoff. `integrate stage` applies queue and plan status
and phase archival once on the merged candidate tree. The queue retains `[ ]`
until then; in-progress state is derived from the canonical branch, registered
worktree, and unarchived record.

Close a validated task with `meridian worktree advance`. After verifying the
acceptance criteria, running validation, and committing the completion record
and handoff, run `meridian worktree advance <TASK-ID> --project
<primary-checkout> --format json` from the primary checkout, giving each result
as `--validation-command`/`--validation-exit-code` with `--accepted`. Perform
exactly its `action_required`, rerun it with the results (candidate validation
uses `--candidate-command`/`--candidate-exit-code`), and report its `BLOCKED <CODE>`
line when it stops. `docs/WORKTREE_LIFECYCLE.md` keeps the single-step commands
for diagnosis and manual recovery.
A named sandbox skip is not a validation failure only when the test itself
reports it and no acceptance criterion depends solely on that test. Record its
test name, reason, and reporting command as `Validation skips:` in the handoff.

## Command triggers

- `Proceed with <TASK-ID>` — implement only that task using Lean Delivery.
- `Review <TASK-ID>` — perform a read-only, risk-proportionate review of that task and report findings or approval.
