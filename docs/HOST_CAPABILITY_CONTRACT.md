# Host Capability Contract

Status: Design baseline. This document records host-specific evidence and
release expectations; it does not itself create a task, change a template, or
claim that an unimplemented control is enforced.

## Purpose

Meridian has one workflow policy, but Claude Code and Codex reach that policy
through different instruction files, plugin/skill distribution paths, tools,
approval systems, and trust models. A workflow rule is not an effective
constraint merely because its prose exists in both host-facing assets.

Every claim about a host-dependent capability therefore identifies a concrete
host profile and one of these states:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `enforced` | The host invokes a verified adapter that prevents the prohibited action. |
| `advisory` | The host receives guidance or a reminder, but can still bypass it. |
| `unsupported` | Meridian intentionally provides no adapter for this host profile. |
| `unverified` | An adapter, claim, or runtime path exists but lacks the required evidence. |

An installed file is not evidence that a capability is active. For a
host-managed adapter, distinguish `installed`, `configured`, `trusted`, and
`effective`; only the last state supports an `enforced` claim.

## Host profiles

The contract applies to a versioned profile, not an umbrella product name.
At minimum, release evidence names the host, host version, invocation mode,
and relevant configuration layer.

| Profile | Distribution path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code plugin session | Claude plugin, `CLAUDE.md`, slash commands, plugin hooks | Plugin lifecycle and the native `Read` tool are distinct from Codex shell execution. |
| Codex project session | `AGENTS.md`, optional Codex skill, project `.codex/` files | Project hooks and rules require the project's Codex configuration layer to be trusted. |
| Codex plugin session | Codex plugin hook/configuration plus `AGENTS.md` | Plugin hooks also require trust; `PLUGIN_ROOT` is available and `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` remains a compatibility variable. |
| Host-neutral CLI | `bin/meridian` and managed project files | The CLI may be common, but PATH, current directory, sandbox, and approval behavior remain host-specific. |

## Capability matrix

| Capability | Claude Code profile | Codex project profile | Required evidence before an enforcement claim |
|---|---|---|---|
| Workflow router and language policy | `CLAUDE.md` supplies the route and policy. | `AGENTS.md` supplies the route and policy; a skill is an optional reusable layer. | Fresh-session evidence of the auto-loaded entry point, route selection, and policy salience. Byte equality alone is insufficient. |
| Managed entry-point integrity | Template/generator tests preserve expected `CLAUDE.md` content. | Template/generator tests preserve expected `AGENTS.md` content. | Static generator and audit tests plus one host-session route fixture per release that changes routing. |
| Queue and language briefing | `UserPromptSubmit` hook is an advisory salience aid. | No equivalent adapter is distributed. | Claude: plugin-hook invocation fixture. Codex: retain `unsupported` unless a trusted adapter and probe are shipped. |
| Authority excerpts and execution budgets | Available through the Meridian CLI when the plugin root resolves it. | Available through the Meridian CLI when `MERIDIAN_ROOT`/PATH and cwd resolve it. | Per-profile bootstrap/doctor check proving the exact command can be found and executed from a project subdirectory. |
| Large-file read guard | Existing plugin hook targets the native `Read` tool; unit tests cover its policy semantics. | The governed-SDD `.codex/hooks.json` adapter intercepts recognised Bash reads after project-hook trust. | Native payload fixture and real hook invocation for Claude; recorded Codex payload, parser table, denial fixture, trust proof, and no false-deny regression for Codex. |
| Command approval policy | No Meridian-managed, project-scoped equivalent is currently shipped. | `templates/workflows/governed-sdd/.codex/rules/meridian.rules` is distributed on upgrade, but it is effective only after project-layer trust. | A decision table evaluated by the host plus a real trusted-project chain test. Approval evidence does not prove sandbox access. |
| Trust activation | Must be observed for the installed plugin/hook definition. | Local rules/hooks are inactive until the project layer and current hook definition are trusted. | An activation check that distinguishes missing, untrusted, trusted, and effective states. |
| Shell and chained commands | Host-specific behavior must not be inferred from rule text. | Codex CLI 0.155.1 trusted-project probe: an all-allowed `&&` chain ran without a prompt; a force-push chain was refused; an unmatched later `git rebase` segment still ran. Governed sessions must issue one command per call. | A fixture for simple command, chain, pipe, redirection, and unsupported syntax, with the expected allow/deny behavior recorded per host. |
| Sandbox and Git operations | Permission and filesystem outcomes depend on the runtime environment. | Approval rules cannot override filesystem sandboxing, network restrictions, or Git worktree restrictions. | A host-specific preflight that reports whether the intended Git/filesystem operation is executable, needs approval, or is unavailable. |
| Review isolation | Task-tool or a fresh independent session may provide isolation. | A separate thread/subagent may provide isolation when available; otherwise use a fresh chat. | The skill must state the current adapter and fallback without assuming a host limitation that has not been verified for the current version. |
| Upgrade and adoption entry point | Claude commands use `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`. | Codex guidance uses `MERIDIAN_ROOT`/CLI discovery. | One clean project upgrade/adoption check from each host profile that the release claims to support. |

## Verified Claude Code read-guard probe

On 2026-09-20, a temporary Meridian-shaped repository with a 401-line target
file was used with Claude Code `2.1.278`, model `claude-sonnet-5`, and the
Meridian plugin loaded directly through `--plugin-dir`.

| Question | Result |
|---|---|
| Does the Meridian plugin load? | Yes. Claude reported the Meridian plugin and its hooks in the session metadata. |
| Does `PreToolUse:Read` fire for a native Read? | Yes. |
| Is an unranged over-threshold Read prevented? | Yes. The hook exited `2`, returned its structured deny output, and the tool result was classified as a non-execution permission rule. |
| Does the model receive an actionable reason? | Yes. It reported that the 401-line read was blocked by the 400-line threshold. |

This verifies the existing Claude read guard for this direct-plugin CLI profile.
It does not by itself prove that a marketplace-installed plugin, another Claude
runtime, or a different tool path loads the same hook definition.

## Verified Claude Code marketplace install probe

On 2026-09-30, Claude Code `2.1.285` was run with an isolated
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` against the real tags `v1.1.49` and `v1.1.50` of
`biagiolibe/meridian`. Both tags predate the marketplace rename, so the
marketplace in this probe was named `meridian-local`; the name `meridian`
(`meridian@meridian`) has not been exercised against a published tag.

| Question | Result |
|---|---|
| Does `claude plugin marketplace add biagiolibe/meridian#v1.1.49` pin to the tag? | Yes. The marketplace source was recorded as `biagiolibe/meridian@v1.1.49`. |
| Does `claude plugin install` from the pinned marketplace install that tag? | Yes. The plugin reported version `1.1.49`, with the tagged commit in `installed_plugins.json`. |
| Can the marketplace be re-added at a different tag? | No. Claude Code refused: the source differs from the one declared in settings. |
| Does `claude plugin marketplace remove` keep the installed plugin? | No. The plugin was uninstalled with it. |
| Does remove, add at `#v1.1.50`, then install move the plugin? | Yes. The plugin reported version `1.1.50`; the `1.1.49` cache entry remained on disk. |
| Does `claude plugin update` move a pinned plugin to a newer tag? | No. It reported the plugin already at the latest version for the pinned tag. |
| Does `bin/meridian` exist in the installed plugin cache and run? | Yes. The cached `bin/meridian` of `1.1.50` ran and printed its usage. |

Still unverified: the `meridian@meridian` name against a published tag, and
`/plugin marketplace update meridian` for an unpinned marketplace moving to a
newer release. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` expansion inside a live Claude session
was not exercised; only the file at `<installPath>/bin/meridian` was. The probe
does not cover Codex.

## Verified Codex hook probe

On 2026-09-20, a scratch Git repository was used with Codex CLI 0.155.1 and a
trusted project-local `.codex/hooks.json` logging hook.

| Question | Result |
|---|---|
| Does `PreToolUse` fire for the shell path? | Yes. |
| What tool name is exposed? | `Bash`. |
| Where is the command? | `tool_input.command`. |
| Are multiline input and `&&` preserved? | Yes; both arrive in the one command string. |
| Can a hook block the entire invocation? | Yes. A hook emitting a reason on stderr and exiting `2` blocked both sides of an `&&` chain before either ran. |
| Is JSON alone sufficient with exit `2`? | No in this probe: Codex reported that no blocking reason had been written to stderr and the chain ran. |
| Does trust matter after a hook change? | Yes. Changing the hook definition required a new manual trust review before it ran. |

This established task 041's probe classification A for this profile. The
subsequent implementation added the parser, exemptions, managed distribution,
and redacted fixtures; other Codex runtimes remain unverified.

Task 041 subsequently recorded redacted individual `sed`, chain, `cat`, and
`rg` payload fixtures. The trusted definition is stored in
`~/.codex/config.toml` under `hooks.state`, keyed as
`<project>/.codex/hooks.json:pre_tool_use:0:0`; changing it requires another
manual `/hooks` review. The hook process had the project cwd, `MERIDIAN_ROOT`,
and a PATH containing `MERIDIAN_ROOT/bin` (but no `PLUGIN_ROOT`). Its deny
probe confirmed that stderr plus exit `2` blocks the whole chain and conveys
the reason; structured JSON is supplementary.

On 2026-09-20, a trusted Palimpsest project session denied both a 2,520-line
project file and `cat /private/tmp/meridian-read-guard-probe.txt > /dev/null`
for an external 401-line file before execution. Together with task 042's
external-path regression fixture, this is enforcement evidence for the named
trusted Codex project-session profile, not for a Codex plugin session or every
future Codex runtime.

## Required host-impact gate

Before a task changes a workflow rule, hook, command, generated instruction,
skill, permission policy, or CLI bootstrap path, its task record must state:

1. **Policy outcome** — the host-independent behavior being protected.
2. **Affected profiles** — each host/runtime/version/invocation mode affected,
   plus profiles explicitly out of scope.
3. **Adapter state** — `enforced`, `advisory`, `unsupported`, or `unverified`
   before and after the change.
4. **Activation preconditions** — installation, trust, PATH, cwd, sandbox,
   permissions, and any user action required.
5. **Evidence plan** — static fixture, host execution fixture, and required
   manual observation. A host claim without a matching evidence item remains
   `unverified`.
6. **Fallback** — the safe behavior and user-visible message if the adapter
   cannot run or cannot determine the host payload.

The implementation and review report must repeat the profiles actually
verified. A repository test may prove parser or template semantics, but cannot
by itself promote a host integration to `enforced`.

## Machine setup and worktree-root resolution

Every `meridian worktree` and `meridian codex` command resolves one root in
this order: explicit `--worktree-root`, `MERIDIAN_WORKTREE_ROOT`, the version-1
user configuration, then `~/.meridian/worktrees`. The user configuration is
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/meridian/config.json`, falling back to
`~/.config/meridian/config.json`, and its only keys are `version` and
`worktreeRoot`. It is absent when the built-in default is used. An explicit
value that differs from the environment is blocked with both sources named.
The filesystem root and the user's home are always rejected. A temporary or
repository-local explicit root is visible in the setup plan and should be
used only for bounded testing or legacy cleanup, never as machine setup.

`meridian setup --check` is the read-only machine preflight. It reports the
resolved path and source, whether the directory exists with current-user
ownership and mode `0700`, the Codex profile state (`unconfigured`, `ready`,
`repair-required`, `different-root`, or `blocked`), and every bounded change
that `--apply` would make. `meridian setup --apply` is the only write path: it
creates or repairs the private root, writes the user configuration only for a
non-default root, and delegates the Codex edit to the existing bounded planner
and backup behavior. Repeating it is a no-op. An intact Meridian-owned profile
for another root is `different-root` and may be replaced after consent. A
different root with damaged ownership markers is `blocked`, names the
diverging fields, and must first be reconciled or repaired for its old root;
it is never overwritten silently.

The normal flow is:

1. Install Meridian and put `meridian` on `PATH`.
2. Once per machine, run `meridian setup --check`, review the plan, run
   `meridian setup --apply`, and restart Codex. Claude Code needs no host
   configuration.
3. For a new project, run `meridian init`; lifecycle commands resolve the
   machine root without a project setting.
4. For an existing project, run `meridian upgrade --check` and then the
   consented `--apply` to receive the migrated workflow text.
5. Finish an existing worktree where it is. Clean it only after integration
   with `meridian worktree cleanup --worktree-root <old-root>`; Meridian never
   moves or deletes worktrees automatically.

## Codex task-worktree permission profile

Meridian supports one Codex permission model for shared task worktrees: the
beta permission-profile model. `meridian codex configure --check` resolves the
machine root, parses the user configuration, and prints the exact
managed profile block without writing it. `--apply` is the only write path. It
creates a restrictive backup before the first changed write and atomically
replaces the configuration while retaining unrelated text and comments.

The managed `meridian-worktrees` profile extends Codex's bounded `:workspace`
profile and adds only the selected shared root. It never enables network
access, grants the home directory, or grants unrestricted filesystem access.
Legacy `sandbox_mode`/`sandbox_workspace_write`, malformed TOML, an existing
foreign profile of the same name, and managed restrictions are conflicts, not
inputs to merge. See the official Codex permission-profile and sandbox
documentation: <https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/permissions> and
<https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-approvals-security>.

### Recovery when ownership comments are lost

The comment markers around the managed block are ownership metadata, not the
source of truth: a conforming TOML writer, including a Codex app update, may
move, normalize, or drop them. Meridian therefore classifies the profile from
the parsed configuration. The state is `repair-required` only when
`default_permissions` selects `meridian-worktrees` and that profile is exactly
`description`, `extends = ":workspace"`, and a `workspace_roots` table holding
only the requested root set to `true`. The Meridian-specific description plus
the exact root, parent, and selection are the semantic evidence; no comment is
required.

`--check` prints a unified diff of the bounded change and writes nothing.
Explicit `--apply` is the only write path: it verifies the file is unchanged
since planning, writes a new exclusive owner-only backup
(`config.toml.meridian-repair.bak`, then `.1`, `.2`, ...), and replaces the file
atomically. The repaired file must parse to exactly the same configuration as
before, so unrelated keys, comments, tables, and application settings are
preserved, and repeating the repair is a no-op. Because the profile tables
move into the managed block, a repair may reorder them relative to unrelated
tables; comments inside those two tables are not carried over.

Anything else stays `BLOCKED`, is never adopted or overwritten, and names the
diverging fields: a different root, parent, description, or default selection;
extra grants or roots; a partial match; duplicate tables; inline or dotted
serializations Meridian cannot edit exactly; and legacy sandbox settings.
Intact markers around a profile for another root keep the ordinary managed
replacement path.

Repair proves only that the configuration file is effective. It does not prove
that a running session reloaded the profile or that the host enforces it; start
a fresh session and probe before relying on it.

`meridian codex doctor` reports project trust, the selected permission model,
effective worktree-root write access, command-policy availability, and Git
metadata separately. It also reports `profile-ownership` (`ready`,
`repair-required`, `blocked`, or `not-applicable`) as its own line, independent
of root access, and a single `codex-root-mismatch` line when the profile and
resolved roots differ. Static configuration is not host-execution evidence.
`.git` and the resolved common Git directory remain protected independently;
project execpolicy rules control approval decisions but cannot widen the
filesystem sandbox.

## Host-neutral worktree lifecycle

`meridian worktree path|prepare|check|integrate|cleanup` is the canonical
lifecycle surface for Codex, Claude Code, and direct-terminal use. Codex rules
may allow only those action prefixes; Claude uses its own permission adapter.
The commands validate the current canonical project, task identity, configured
root, repository-qualified path, branch, state, lease ownership, and evidence
before changing Git metadata. They never execute project-controlled commands.

Orchestration prepares the checkout before starting any worker and passes the
returned existing path as a launch input. A worker immediately runs read-only
`check` from that exact directory. A host facility that creates a second
checkout, including a Claude automatic worktree, is not an equivalent adapter;
if the host cannot attach a fresh context to the prepared directory, the
lifecycle is `BLOCKED` and both checkouts are retained. `meridian codex
worktree-path` remains a deprecated path-only alias for one migration window.

## Decision rules

- Prefer a common policy with narrow host adapters over a common parser that
  assumes identical tools or payloads.
- Prefer a false allow to a false deny for advisory shell parsing unless the
  protected operation is independently unsafe; false denials stall legitimate
  work and invite workarounds.
- Treat approval, trust, sandbox access, and execution success as separate
  facts. No one fact implies another.
- Do not add host-specific prose to generic workflow policy when an adapter,
  a profile row, or a fallback statement expresses the requirement more
  precisely.
- Do not describe a capability as cross-host parity until its expected outcome
  has been demonstrated in every profile named by the claim.

## Open evidence

| Item | Current state | Needed evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Claude plugin read-guard activation | `enforced` for the tested direct-plugin Claude Code 2.1.278 profile. | Marketplace-installed plugin activation and any other Claude runtime remain unverified. |
| Codex command approval policy | `enforced` for the Codex CLI 0.155.1 trusted project profile. | Other Codex versions and plugin sessions remain unverified; governed sessions issue one command per invocation. |
| Codex read guard | `enforced` for the trusted Palimpsest Codex project-session profile, including the recorded external absolute-path read. | Other Codex versions and plugin sessions remain unverified. |
| Router auto-load parity | `unverified` as a release-wide claim. | Fresh-session evidence for the actual entry point and route-specific initial reads on both profiles. |
| Codex review-isolation adapter | `unverified`; existing skill language may be stale. | Versioned check of available subagent/thread capability and a documented fresh-chat fallback. |
| Host-neutral CLI bootstrap | `unverified` across profiles. | Subdirectory PATH/cwd checks for authority, upgrade, adoption, and hook entry points. |

## Non-goals

This contract does not introduce a new task lifecycle, make Codex and Claude
mechanically identical, distribute rules or hooks, change the current template
set, or replace a task-specific acceptance criterion. It is the design record
used to scope those changes safely.
