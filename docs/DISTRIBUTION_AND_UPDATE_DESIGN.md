# Distribution and Update Channel Design

Status: decided by task 049, with the project console CLI surface added by task
075. The command remains part of the tagged repository tree; no separate
package or publishing channel is introduced.

## Problem

Today an adopter installs Meridian by cloning `main` and registering the clone
as a **local** marketplace (`meridian-local`, `source: "./"`), or by symlinking
skills for Codex. Nothing says how to install a specific release, learn that a
newer one exists, or move a checkout forward safely before running
`meridian upgrade`. The upgrade CLI is only correct once the adopter already
holds the newer framework files.

The version and ledger mechanics already exist and this design reuses them
unchanged: the three version axes (`frameworkVersion`, `workflowBaselineVersion`,
`protocolVersion`), the append-only `releases/<version>.json` ledger, the
contiguous `migrations/` chain, `release-baselines/`, and the `v<version>` Git
tags (`v1.1.49` and `v1.1.50` already exist; `v1.1.51` is not cut yet).

## Platform facts the design relies on

From the official Claude Code documentation
(<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins/host-marketplace> and
<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins/create-marketplace>):

- A Git repository containing `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is added with
  `/plugin marketplace add owner/repo`; a `#<ref>` suffix pins a branch or tag
  (`your-org/your-marketplace#stable`).
- For a Git-hosted marketplace Claude Code clones the whole tree, so a
  relative `source` such as `"./"` keeps working.
- An installed plugin is a cached copy. It is refreshed only when its computed
  version changes (`plugin.json` `version` first, then the marketplace entry).
  Meridian bumps `plugin.json` `version` with every release (task 046).
- Background auto-update is off by default and is controlled by the user or an
  administrator, not by `marketplace.json`. Without it users run
  `/plugin marketplace update <name>` or `claude plugin update <plugin>@<name>`.
- The marketplace `name` is part of the install id and of the `enabledPlugins`
  key, so it cannot change without migrating existing installs.

From the Codex documentation (<https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills>):

- Skills are directories scanned from `.agents/skills` (repository) and
  `$HOME/.agents/skills` (user). OpenAI recommends plugins for wider
  distribution. The documentation states no versioning or update mechanism for
  skills.

`docs/HOST_CAPABILITY_CONTRACT.md` records that marketplace-installed Claude
plugin activation and Codex plugin sessions are **unverified**. Every claim
below that depends on installed-plugin behavior is therefore verified
empirically by the implementing task before it is documented as supported.

## Decision 1 — Distribution channels

Meridian is distributed as **one Git repository, consumed two ways**. The
release artifact is the tagged repository tree; there is no second build
artifact.

| Channel | What the adopter installs | Status |
|---------|---------------------------|--------|
| Claude Code marketplace, GitHub-hosted | `/plugin marketplace add biagiolibe/meridian#v<version>` then `/plugin install meridian@meridian`. The plugin cache holds the tagged tree, so `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/meridian` is the CLI. | Primary |
| Codex skills from a tagged checkout | A clone at `v<version>`, `MERIDIAN_ROOT` pointing to it, and the two skill directories symlinked into `$HOME/.agents/skills`. | Supported, manual |

Marketplace rename: the current marketplace name `meridian-local` describes a
local-directory install and would be wrong on a public catalog. The
marketplace `name` becomes `meridian` (install id `meridian@meridian`). This
is a breaking change for anyone who already installed `meridian@meridian-local`;
the implementing task must state the one-time migration (remove the old
marketplace, add the new one) in the README and CHANGELOG.

Rejected alternatives:

- **Python package (PyPI).** The CLI is a stdlib script that resolves
  templates, migrations, and baselines relative to the framework root, plus
  Claude hooks and skills. Packaging it means a second copy of every asset and
  a second version source that could drift from `VERSION`. It also adds a
  publication account and supply-chain surface for a benefit the two host
  channels already cover. Revisit only if adopters appear who use neither
  Claude Code nor Codex.
- **Codex plugin.** Recommended by OpenAI for distribution, but Meridian has no
  verified Codex plugin profile (see the host contract). Adding one now would
  ship an unproven adapter. Revisit after a Codex plugin probe exists.
- **Unpinned `main` as the adopter default.** `main` contains unreleased
  work; adopters must land on a ledger-recorded release.
- **Submission to a third-party or official marketplace directory.** Out of
  scope and outward-facing; it requires a separate developer decision.

### Project console command

The read-only project console is exposed as `meridian console`. It is resolved
from the installed Meridian framework root and operates on the current working
project by default:

```text
meridian console
meridian console --project /path/to/project --interval 5
```

This is a local terminal view with automatic refresh; it does not control
agents, write project state, or require a service. Claude Code receives the
command from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/meridian`. Codex adopters use the
`bin/meridian` launcher from their tagged checkout with `MERIDIAN_ROOT` set to
that checkout. The command is therefore versioned and updated together with
the tagged Meridian tree.

## Decision 2 — Version pinning

The pin is the Git tag `v<version>`, which the ledger already records as
`gitTag`.

- Claude Code: add the marketplace at the tag, `#v<version>`.
- Codex: `git clone --branch v<version>` (or check out the tag) and point
  `MERIDIAN_ROOT` at it.
- An adopter stays on that release until they deliberately move the pin. No
  channel moves an adopter automatically.

Rejected: a moving `stable` branch fast-forwarded by the release workflow. It
would give tag-following updates through `#stable`, but it requires the
release workflow to push a branch and adds a second ref to keep consistent
with the tag. Reconsider after task 050 has proven the tag-driven release.

## Decision 3 — Update discovery

Two layers, both optional for the adopter and neither a requirement for
`meridian upgrade`.

1. **Documentation and GitHub Releases (baseline).** Each release has a
   GitHub Release (task 050) whose body is its `CHANGELOG.md` section. Adopters
   learn of releases through the repository's Releases feed ("Watch" >
   "Releases only"). This works with no Meridian code.
2. **`meridian self-check --check-latest` (opt-in command).** A read-only
   command that prints the installed framework version and compares it with the
   latest GitHub Release (`releases/latest` of the repository). Contract:
   - Network access happens only when this flag is given. `upgrade`, `adopt`,
     hooks, and every other command stay fully offline.
   - Standard library only, short timeout, no credentials, no telemetry, and no
     cache or state file (no new persistence format).
   - Offline, rate-limited, or malformed response: report status `UNKNOWN`
     with the reason and a documented exit code distinct from "update
     available"; never raise a failure that blocks other work.
   - It reports the release kind (CLI-only or template-changing) taken from
     the release body's kind line defined in Decision 5.

Rejected: startup or hook-time update notification (network on every session,
violates the offline default), and a polling background job (persistence and a
new trust surface).

Risk flag: `--check-latest` adds a network dependency and a new public CLI
surface. Meridian remains on its repository-local Lean Delivery lifecycle.
Task 066 therefore requires a fresh-session, read-only review after
implementation and validation and before the normal Lean completion and
integration steps. The task stays in progress until that review returns
`APPROVE`; this adds a risk-proportionate gate without importing Governed SDD
states, roles, or acceptance commits.

## Decision 4 — Update procedure

Ordered adopter steps from "a new release exists" to "project upgraded". The
framework is always updated **before** the project, because the project's
manifest is only readable by a CLI at least as new as its `protocolVersion`.

1. Read the release notes (Decision 5) and note the release kind.
2. Move the pin: for Claude Code, remove the marketplace, add it again at
   the new tag, and reinstall the plugin (removal uninstalls it, and re-adding
   at a different ref is refused; verified in task 065), or use
   `/plugin marketplace update meridian` when it was added without a pin; for
   Codex, fetch and check out the new tag.
3. From the project, run `meridian upgrade --check`.
4. On a clean plan, apply it on a dedicated branch with
   `meridian upgrade --apply`, validate the project, and commit the diff.
   On conflicts, resolve the bounded conflict and rerun; never hand-edit
   `.meridian/manifest.json`.

What each version axis tells the adopter:

| Signal | Meaning | Adopter action |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Only `frameworkVersion` moved (`baselineChanged: false`) | CLI-only release; no managed file changed. | Update the framework; `upgrade --check` shows no managed-file changes. |
| `workflowBaselineVersion` moved (`baselineChanged: true`) | Template-changing release with a migration. | Update the framework, then `upgrade --apply` performs the migration plan. |
| `protocolVersion` newer than the project manifest's | The CLI reads and writes a newer manifest shape; the older manifest stays readable. | No extra step beyond `upgrade`. |
| Project manifest `protocolVersion` newer than the CLI's | The project was upgraded by a newer framework. | The CLI refuses with guidance (task 048); update the framework first. |

The adopter confirms the move by comparing the installed framework version
(the tag without its `v`) with the project's `frameworkVersion` in
`.meridian/manifest.json` after `upgrade --apply`, rather than trusting the
plugin manager alone.

Pre-manifest projects follow the existing `meridian adopt` path; this design
does not change it.

## Decision 5 — Adopter-facing release notes

Both locations, with `CHANGELOG.md` as the single source and the GitHub Release
body generated from it (task 050 already specifies that generation plus a link
to `releases/<version>.json`).

Every release section states its kind in its first line, matching the ledger:

- **CLI-only** — "CLI-only release: no template, workflow rule, or managed
  file changed" (existing wording). No adopter action beyond the update.
- **Template-changing** — the existing first line naming the migration ids and
  the new `workflowBaselineVersion`, plus an **Upgrade notes** subsection that
  lists: the affected capabilities and managed paths an adopter will see in
  `upgrade --check`, the required action (`upgrade --apply`), likely
  conflict areas for adapted projects, and any minimum framework version or
  `protocolVersion` change.

A mechanical check that the section's first line agrees with
`baselineChanged` and that a template-changing section has an Upgrade notes
subsection belongs in the release-notes follow-up task.

## Decision 6 — Support policy

Consistent with `migrations/`, `release-baselines/`, and the append-only
ledger:

- **Upgrade window.** Every published release from `v1.1.49` (the oldest
  release published as a tag) forward is upgradable to the newest release in a
  single `upgrade --apply`, proved by
  `test_oldest_published_release_upgrades_to_current_in_one_apply`. Migrations
  and packaged baselines are never removed while this policy holds.
  Amended by task 068: the original `1.0.0` window does not hold, because a
  pristine `1.0.0` project adopts with conflicts at migrations `037` and `038`
  (task 090, cancelled on 2026-10-03: the narrower window stays). Projects older than
  `v1.1.49` use `meridian adopt` best-effort.
- **Skipping releases** is supported; adopters need not step through
  intermediate releases.
- **Fixes land only in the newest release.** There are no backport branches; a
  correction ships as a new release, as the ledger rules already require.
- **Unsupported:** downgrades, manifests whose installed baseline is not
  recorded (use `meridian adopt`), and unreleased `main`.
- **Changing the window** (dropping the oldest baseline) requires a
  CHANGELOG-announced release and a migration or `adopt` path for affected
  projects; it is not done implicitly.

## Follow-up implementation tasks

All are added to `tasks/QUEUE.md` and `PROJECT_PLAN.md` as `[ ]`.

| ID | Objective | Depends on | Notes |
|----|-----------|------------|-------|
| 065 | Rename the marketplace to `meridian`, rewrite the README install and update sections around `#v<version>`, verify pinned add, plugin update, and CLI path resolution from an installed plugin, and document the `meridian-local` migration. | 049 | Outward-facing docs; first published tag needed to fully verify. |
| 066 | Add `meridian self-check --check-latest` per Decision 3. | 049, 050, 065 | Network dependency and public CLI surface: require an independent read-only review before Lean completion and integration. |
| 067 | Enforce the release-notes contract: `CHANGELOG.md` kind line agrees with the ledger and a template-changing section has Upgrade notes; feed the same into the GitHub Release body. | 049, 050 | Extends the task 050 script. |
| 068 | Document and test the support policy: one upgrade test spanning the oldest packaged baseline to current, and README/CONTRIBUTING statements of the window. | 049 | No CLI behavior change expected. |
| 069 | Document Codex install from a tagged checkout, verify the user skills directory and `MERIDIAN_ROOT` resolution, and record the result in the host capability contract. | 049 | Keeps Codex plugin distribution deferred. |

## Out of scope

Publishing to any marketplace directory or package index, creating tags or
releases, and any code change. Those follow from the tasks above and, where
outward-facing, need a separate developer decision.
