# Task Execution Queue

This is the operational execution queue. Tasks are ordered by priority.

Fully closed phases or sections (all `[x]`) belong in `QUEUE_ARCHIVE.md`, not here.
This file tracks only work with open items, keeping the reading cost low in every
session.

Authority for this queue: [docs/AUDIT_TOKEN_EFFICIENCY.md](../docs/AUDIT_TOKEN_EFFICIENCY.md)
(evidence) and [docs/PLAN_TOKEN_EFFICIENCY.md](../docs/PLAN_TOKEN_EFFICIENCY.md)
(rationale and sequencing).

## How to use this queue

- **Execution**: Take the first available `[ ]` task whose dependencies are `[x]`.
- **Update**: Change `[ ]` to `[/]` when starting and to `[x]` when finishing.
- **Delegation**: Follow the delegation block at the end of each task file.
- **Task-file archive**: When a task is complete, move its file to `tasks/done/`.
- **Queue archive**: When an entire phase becomes `[x]`, move its rows to
  `tasks/QUEUE_ARCHIVE.md` instead of accumulating them here.

## Priorities

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 🔴 P1 | Blocking / Critical |
| 🟡 P2 | Important feature |
| 🟢 P3 | Optimization / Polish |

## 🏃 Active Queue
