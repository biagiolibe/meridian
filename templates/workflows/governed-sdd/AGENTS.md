# [Project Name] — Agent Rules

Read `PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md` before acting. It defines the canonical task lifecycle, review rules, roles, and Git workflow.

Work only on the explicitly assigned task. Before implementation, read the assigned task, its cited authority, its expected code surface, and `git status --short`; state a short plan and stop if unrelated changes or an unresolved higher-precedence conflict exist.

Run the task validation plus the project baseline checks recorded in `CLAUDE.md`/project documentation. Never claim completion when required validation fails.

## Execution policies

Apply `docs/CONTEXT_BUDGET_POLICY.md` for task-first context loading, progressive expansion, and reasoning selection. Use `tasks/TASK_BLUEPRINT.md` for new or materially revised tasks and `docs/COMPLETION_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` for the completion handoff.

These documents define operating detail; this file remains the source for stable agent-wide rules and project invariants.

## Code organization

Follow `docs/CODE_ORGANIZATION.md` for every production-source change: one owning module per responsibility, preserved dependency direction between layers, narrowest working visibility, and structural refactors kept out of behavior-change tasks. If a task needs a new ownership boundary or cannot fit the documented module structure without coupling responsibilities, stop and report the missing architectural decision instead of creating an opportunistic abstraction.

## Command triggers

Treat these developer phrases as the complete authorization for the named workflow. Do not select a different task or act on an unassigned one.

- `Proceed with <TASK-ID>` — run the implementation workflow below for exactly that task.
- `Review <TASK-ID>` — act as an independent reviewer-integrator using `docs/CODE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md`.
- `Accept <TASK-ID>` — run the owner-acceptance workflow below.

### Implementation workflow

1. Read the assigned task, every referenced higher-precedence specification/ADR, and `git status --short`.
2. Before code changes, ensure the worktree contains no unrelated uncommitted changes. If it does, do not stage, modify, discard, or commit those changes; report the exact conflict and stop unless the developer explicitly directs how to proceed.
3. Create and switch to a dedicated branch named after the normalized task ID, without a provider prefix (for example, `TASK-012` uses `task-012`). Only one task may write in this checkout at a time. If the branch already exists, inspect it and stop for direction rather than overwriting or rebasing it. Do not create or switch branches in a dirty checkout.
4. State a short plan, then implement only the assigned task and its explicit dependencies. Preserve architectural boundaries and all SDD scope limits.
5. Run the task's validation commands and the project baseline checks, unless a command is inapplicable because the task has not yet established the required project artifact. Report any inapplicable command and why.
6. When every required validation passes, record completion according to the task's review policy: `READY_FOR_REVIEW` for `Review: REQUIRED`, `ACCEPTED` for `Review: NOT_REQUIRED`. Make no status change if any validation failed, a required manual check is incomplete, or acceptance criteria are not met.
7. Review the diff to confirm it contains only the assigned task and its required status updates. Create one atomic commit using Conventional Commit style and the task ID. Follow `docs/PULL_REQUEST_POLICY.md` for the branch push and hand-off.
8. Report the branch name, commit hash, changed files, acceptance-criteria evidence, validation results, and assumptions. If validation fails or scope is ambiguous, do not commit a partial implementation; report the blocker.

Never run two writing agents concurrently in the same worktree.

## Owner-acceptance workflow

When the developer says `Accept <TASK-ID>` after personally reviewing a `Review: REQUIRED` task, treat it as explicit authorization to skip the agent review and perform only the acceptance-state handoff. Confirm that the task and its canonical queue row are both `READY_FOR_REVIEW`; do not re-review the implementation, rerun validation, change source code, or merge the branch.

Update exactly the task `Status` and its canonical queue row to `ACCEPTED`, and commit only those two edits as `docs: accept <TASK-ID>` on the existing local task branch. Report the commit. If the required state records are missing or inconsistent, stop and report `BLOCKED`.

## Implementer-to-reviewer handoff

After validation, create the task commit and push the task branch exactly once. The completion handoff must record the branch name, implementation commit, and base `main` commit. Leave the primary checkout clean and on the task branch; do not switch back to `main`.

The reviewer-integrator uses that same primary checkout in a fresh agent session that did not write the implementation. If the reviewer session starts on clean `main`, run `git switch <task-branch>`. If the branch is missing locally, or a dirty checkout prevents switching, return `BLOCKED` with the exact condition.

For `Review: REQUIRED`, the reviewer must never push the task branch. Before changing either status record, run `git merge-base --is-ancestor main <task-branch>`. If it fails, do not mark the task `ACCEPTED`; return `BLOCKED` with no fetch, rebase, non-fast-forward merge, or force-push recovery. If it passes, create the local status-only `ACCEPTED` commit, switch to `main`, fast-forward merge the task branch, push `main` exactly once, and delete the local task branch. For `Review: NOT_REQUIRED`, the implementer performs the same acceptance commit and main integration after validation. Owner acceptance is status-only and does not automatically integrate the branch.

## Reviewer-integrator identity on a single-operator project

Both controls are mandatory and neither substitutes for the other:

- Review runs in a fresh agent session that did not write the code. Re-derive evidence from the actual diff and cited sources; do not trust the implementation report.
- Only for the `ACCEPTED` commit, use the project-scoped reviewer author override below, with the project's actual name and slug:

  ```bash
  git commit --author="<PROJECT_NAME> Reviewer-Integrator <reviewer-integrator@<project-slug>.local>" -m "docs: reviewer-integrator pass <TASK-ID>; independently re-verified diff, cited sources, acceptance evidence, and validation"
  ```

Keep the operator's normal committer identity. Do not change global or repository Git config. The override applies only to the `ACCEPTED` commit and can be verified with `git log --format='%an <%ae>'`.
