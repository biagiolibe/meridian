# [Project Name] — Agent Rules

Read `PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md` before acting. It defines the canonical task lifecycle, review rules, roles, and Git workflow.

Work only on the explicitly assigned task. Before implementation, read the assigned task, its cited authority, its expected code surface, and `git status --short`; state a short plan and stop if unrelated changes or an unresolved higher-precedence conflict exist.

Run the task validation plus the project baseline checks recorded in `CLAUDE.md`/project documentation. Never claim completion when required validation fails.

## Execution policies

Apply `docs/CONTEXT_BUDGET_POLICY.md` for task-first context loading, progressive expansion, and reasoning selection. Use `tasks/TASK_BLUEPRINT.md` for new or materially revised tasks and `docs/COMPLETION_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` for the completion handoff.

These documents define operating detail; this file remains the source for stable agent-wide rules and project invariants.
