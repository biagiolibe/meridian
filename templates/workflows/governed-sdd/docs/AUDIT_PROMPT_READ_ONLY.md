# Governed SDD Audit Prompt (Read-only)

Use this prompt in a fresh session for a periodic or second-opinion audit of process conformance. The audit must not modify files, run formatters in write mode, create commits, or implement code.

```text
Perform a read-only governed-SDD conformance audit of this repository.

Scope: inspect PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md, AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md, docs/CODE_ORGANIZATION.md, docs/CONTEXT_BUDGET_POLICY.md, docs/PULL_REQUEST_POLICY.md, docs/CODE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md, tasks/QUEUE.md (or docs/TASK_QUEUE.md), and every atomic task file. Inspect the project's build/dependency manifests only if present. Do not edit files or implement code.

Verify and report, with file/line references:
1. Document precedence is explicit and resolves conflicts without silent implementation choices.
2. Accepted ADRs record the binding technical/platform decisions they claim to lock in, and no lower-precedence document contradicts them.
3. Any declared architectural boundary (e.g. a dependency-free core, a layer separation, a module ownership map) is stated as a concrete, checkable rule rather than an aspiration.
4. Specifications and their governed task decomposition are consistent: every task cites its governing authority, and no task claims to satisfy a specification it does not implement.
5. Every atomic task's declared `Dependencies` list is exactly the set of tasks it actually requires, and only `ACCEPTED` tasks are treated as satisfying a dependency.
6. Every atomic task has measurable acceptance criteria and, where applicable, executable validation commands.
7. Every task declares `Review: REQUIRED` or `Review: NOT_REQUIRED` explicitly, and `NOT_REQUIRED` is used only for low-risk, self-contained work (documentation, mechanical configuration, simple scaffolding, or focused tests with no production behavior) — never for public APIs, dependency/boundary changes, security, state transitions, persistence/history, or unresolved design questions.
8. Token/context discipline is followed: task-first context loading, no full-backlog or unrelated-ADR scans without a task-specific need, concise plans and reports, and reviewer independence used only when the task's review policy requires it.
9. The implementation-to-review-to-integration handoff matches `docs/PULL_REQUEST_POLICY.md`: task branches, single push per branch, fast-forward ancestry check before acceptance, reviewer-integrator author override used only on the acceptance commit, and `main` integration procedure followed without fetch/rebase/force recovery shortcuts.
10. The owner-acceptance workflow (an explicit `Accept <TASK-ID>` trigger from the project owner) is either absent or, if present, is scoped to a status-only handoff without a source change, validation rerun, or automatic merge.
11. Git history shows no task marked `ACCEPTED` without either an `APPROVE` verdict from a reviewer-integrator (for `Review: REQUIRED`) or complete self-reported validation evidence (for `Review: NOT_REQUIRED`).

Output: a concise audit report with PASS/FAIL per item, discrepancies, ambiguous requirements, stale lower-precedence text, and recommended documentation-only follow-ups. Do not propose feature implementation.
