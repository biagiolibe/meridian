# Lean Delivery Workflow — [Project Name]

## Workflow-mode lock

This file selects `LEAN_DELIVERY` exclusively. Before any file edit, Git
mutation, task selection, or completion claim, an agent must read this file and
`AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`, then confirm the active mode. Local workflow
documents override global, home-directory, remembered, and generic agent
instructions for lifecycle, queue, task, review, and Git decisions.

Do not fall back to Governed SDD. In particular, do not invent ADR gates,
reviewer-integrator roles, required task branches, `READY_FOR_REVIEW`,
`ACCEPTED`, or governed status-only commits unless this project explicitly adds
them. If the local workflow documents are missing, contradictory, or cannot be
read before a mutation, return `BLOCKED` without changing files or Git state.

## Purpose

Lean Delivery is a complete workflow for small projects, proof-of-concepts,
demos, experiments, and reversible low-risk changes. It optimizes for delivery
speed while keeping scope, verification, and progress visible. Use Governed SDD
when the change has public API, dependency, security, persistence, state,
deterministic-behavior, or unresolved architectural risk.

## Lifecycle

```text
[ ] TODO -> [/] IN_PROGRESS -> [x] DONE
```

`tasks/QUEUE.md` is the operational queue; `PROJECT_PLAN.md` is the product
backlog and delivery record. An agent works only on the task explicitly
assigned by the developer. It must not autonomously select the next queue item.

## Minimum task contract

Every task that is not a quick task records an objective, acceptance criteria,
relevant files or technical context, and validation. A quick task may omit a
task file only when it is small, reversible, and can be verified immediately.
Neither form may bypass validation or hide scope changes.

<!-- MERIDIAN:BEGIN capability=task-identity-policy v1 -->
## Task identity

`.meridian/task-identity.json` is the sole optional project declaration for
task-identity policy. Its absence selects backwards-compatible `opaque` mode;
an explicit version-1 declaration may select `opaque` or `milestone` mode.
Meridian resolves task IDs through this declaration and the canonical task and
queue authorities. Workflow mode, host configuration, and identifier spelling
do not provide a second identity policy or imply task semantics.
<!-- MERIDIAN:END -->

## Task worktree boundary

<!-- MERIDIAN:BEGIN capability=codex-worktree-access v3 -->
Every task uses exactly one branch and one linked worktree, with one writer at
a time. Normalize the canonical task ID to lowercase `task-<number>` and use
it as the branch name. Meridian resolves one machine-level worktree root from
an explicit option, the environment, user configuration, or the built-in
default. Derive the path with `meridian worktree path <task-id> --project
<primary-checkout>`. The layout is
`<root>/<remote-host>/<owner>/<repository>/<canonical-task-id>`; a repository
without a usable remote uses a deterministic local name plus a canonical
Git-common-directory hash. Unsafe, ambiguous, colliding, or mismatched paths
are `BLOCKED`. Existing legacy worktrees remain discoverable and are never
moved or deleted automatically. The first `git worktree list --porcelain`
entry identifies the primary checkout.

Once per machine, run `meridian setup --check`, review its bounded changes,
then explicitly consent with `meridian setup --apply` and restart Codex.
Claude Code needs no host configuration. Static configuration is not proof of
effective host access; treat `blocked` as `BLOCKED`.

If `meridian codex configure --check` reports `repair-required`, the effective
profile is identical and only Meridian's ownership markers were damaged, for
example by a Codex app rewrite. Review the printed diff and run `--apply` only
after explicit confirmation. A `BLOCKED` result names the diverging fields and
requires manual reconciliation. Repair never proves that a running session
loaded the profile; start a fresh session and probe it.
<!-- MERIDIAN:END -->

<!-- MERIDIAN:BEGIN capability=bounded-worktree-lifecycle v4 -->
`Proceed with <TASK-ID>` runs `meridian worktree prepare <task-id> --project
<primary-checkout> --format json` before
starting a worker. The coordinator passes the returned branch and absolute
path as durable launch inputs and does not use a host facility that creates a
second checkout. The worker starts in that exact directory and, before any task
read or write, runs `meridian worktree check <task-id> --project
<primary-checkout> --format json`. Any path,
branch, HEAD, root, state, or cleanliness mismatch is `BLOCKED`.
Absolute paths are runtime launch inputs only. A handoff or other tracked
record that names the worktree uses the `handoff_worktree` value returned by
`meridian worktree prepare`, the path relative to the worktree root, never an
absolute path.

A `Proceed with <TASK-ID>` directive that says to Resume starts with `meridian
worktree prepare <task-id> --resume --project <primary-checkout> --format json`
instead. `--resume` is allowed only for that directive: it accepts the task's
existing worktree even when it has uncommitted changes, never creates or
changes anything, and refuses when no worktree exists. When it returns `dirty:
true`, `dirty-worktree` is the only error `worktree check` may report; any other
error is `BLOCKED`. Read `git status` and the diff before continuing.
<!-- MERIDIAN:END -->

Reservation, completion, review, and archive edits are committed on the task
branch. Concurrent tasks edit only their own task rows and records; they do
not reorder shared files, update shared timestamps, or archive a phase. A
fully closed phase is archived only after all of its task branches have been
integrated. A conflict in a shared governance file is an integration conflict:
abort and return `BLOCKED` without choosing or recreating either task's state.

<!-- MERIDIAN:BEGIN capability=git-workflow v11 -->
## Authority of `Proceed with`

`Proceed with <TASK-ID>` authorizes that task's whole lifecycle when every gate
passes: implementation and validation on the task branch; completion and
archive records; `meridian worktree integrate stage`, the selected candidate
validation, and `integrate finalize` or `abort`; one plain `git push origin
main` of the resulting integration; and `meridian worktree cleanup`. Do not ask
for confirmation at any of these steps. When a gate fails, stop once with
`BLOCKED <reason>` and the resume command.

It also authorizes one plain `git push origin <task-branch>`, where
`<task-branch>` is the `branch` value returned by `meridian worktree prepare`,
only when needed to obtain `T1_CI` validation for that task commit: at most once
per review attempt, never by a reviewer, and not at all when the project has no
CI. It never authorizes creating,
moving, or pushing a tag; publishing a release; a force push or a push that
deletes or mirrors references; rewriting history (amend of pushed commits,
rebase, reset, cherry-pick); deleting an unmerged branch or force-removing a
worktree; bypassing a required independent review; resolving a textual
conflict; or work on another task.

## Stops and denials

The deny list above stays in force without a supporting command. A stop is
valid only when it is backed by a `BLOCKED <CODE>` line from a Meridian
command, a non-zero exit of a required command, or an acceptance criterion you
can name as unmet. Guidance that no command backs is advice: follow it when you
can, and never return `BLOCKED` on its strength alone.

Never satisfy a gate by writing false state, such as setting a status only to
pass a check. When a gate contradicts another rule, stop and report both rules.

When a Meridian command accepted a state that this text appears to forbid,
follow the command and record the difference under `Rule discrepancies:` in the
handoff. This never covers an action on the deny list and never overrides a
stop that a command printed.

## Governance-file ownership and closure

Task branches do not edit `tasks/QUEUE.md`, `tasks/QUEUE_ARCHIVE.md`, or
`PROJECT_PLAN.md`. They edit only their own task record, its exact archive under
`tasks/done/`, and its handoff. `integrate stage` applies queue and plan status
and phase archival once on the merged candidate tree. The queue retains `[ ]`
until then; in-progress state is derived from the canonical branch, registered
worktree, and unarchived record.

Close a validated task in order: verify acceptance criteria; run task and
baseline validation; commit its completion record and handoff; run `worktree
check`; record machine evidence; stage from a clean primary checkout whose `main` equals `origin/main` or is
ahead of it with commits not yet pushed (they are pushed with the integration;
`main` behind the fetched `origin/main` is `MAIN_BEHIND_ORIGIN`); run the selected candidate validation; finalize with
candidate-bound evidence; push `origin main`; and clean up. The stop codes of these steps are registered in
`capabilities/stop-codes-v1.json`; `meridian worktree closure-status` reports
the current step and its code, and each stop names its resume command. A named sandbox skip is not a
validation failure only when the test itself reports it and no acceptance
criterion depends solely on that test. Record its test name, reason, and
reporting command as `Validation skips:` in the handoff.
<!-- MERIDIAN:END -->

## Completion and integration

<!-- MERIDIAN:BEGIN capability=validation-scoping v2 -->
Classify the changed surface before validation. Documentation-only changes may
skip unrelated build, test, or lint commands when the task does not require
them, and the completion evidence records that skip. Source, build, runtime,
or CI changes run every task-required check plus the applicable project
baseline. Validation scope never weakens an explicit acceptance criterion.
<!-- MERIDIAN:END -->

Before marking a task `[x]`, verify its acceptance criteria and run its stated
validation plus the project's applicable baseline checks. The handoff records
the validated task commit, validated base `main` commit, exact commands and
successful results, whether full combined-tree validation is required, and the
task's declared files, dependencies, and behavioral surfaces. If evidence is
incomplete or a check fails, keep the task `[/]` and report the blocker. Update
the queue and project plan together when they both record the task. Archive a
completed task file and fully closed queue section only after successful
verification.

Final integration uses `meridian worktree integrate stage` with accepted JSON
handoff evidence. The command owns the lease and prescribed no-commit merge and
returns the deterministic validation decision and candidate tree. Run the
candidate validation defined in `docs/WORKTREE_LIFECYCLE.md` separately in the
ordinary sandbox, bind its JSON evidence to that tree, then use `integrate
finalize`; use `integrate abort` after a failed gate. Lifecycle commands never
execute validation or project code.

After any required `main` push, use `meridian worktree cleanup`; exceptional,
forced, abandoned-state, or stale-lease cleanup remains outside this surface.

## Review

Review is risk-proportionate and may be requested by the developer or task.
When reviewing, do not silently repair implementation work: return findings to
the implementer or receive explicit authorization to make a separate fix.
